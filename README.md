- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @yrlbaker
- I'm an accountant, author, and I have an MBA.
- I'm currently a student of the Rice University FinTech Bootcamp program.
- I do have some programming knowledge, but this is all fairly new to me.
- However, I am a voracious reader and I love to learn.
- I expect the bootcamp to be challenging, and I am open to the challenge!
