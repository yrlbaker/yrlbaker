- ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm Yolanda Baker.
- I'm a recent graduate of The Rice University FinTech Bootcamp program.
- I'm a Blockchain Developer, Accountant, author, and MBA graduate.
- My startup, Proof of Ability, will promote Special Needs and Underrepresented NFT artists.
- Proof of Ability projects: Blockchain/Token/Crypto/NFT Gallery/Metaverse for the Special Needs Community.
- The proceeds from our NFT auctions will help build a special needs artist colony in Austin, Texas.
- I am a voracious reader and love to write.
- My interests are Art History and Forensic Accounting, although I confess I am a novice with both of these subjects. :)
