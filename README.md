- ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm Yolanda Baker.
- I'm a recent graduate of The Rice University FinTech Bootcamp program.
- I'm a Blockchain Developer, Accountant, author, and MBA graduate.
- My startup, Proof of Ability, will promote Special Needs and Underrepresented NFT artists.
- Proof of Ability's goal is to create a Special Needs artist colony/residence in Austin.
- The proceeds from our NFT auctions will help fund the artist colony.
- ProofOfAbility.org will be setup by mid-September.
- I am a voracious reader and love to write.
- My interests are Art History and Forensic Accounting, although I confess I am a novice with both of these subjects. :)
